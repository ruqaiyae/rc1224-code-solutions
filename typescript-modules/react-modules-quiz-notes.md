## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

  Modules are collections of code in external files. A program can be divided into multiple files using modules that are exported and imported.

- What is the difference between named and default imports?
  With default imports, we can use any name for the module that is being imported, however, with named imports, the name of the entity being imported must remain the same.

- What is the difference between named and default exports?
  Each module can have one default export. But there can be multiple named exports since each export will have its own unique name.
